## Introduction 

Have you ever tried to search for some tools to make you program more happily? Do you like to change the theme or background to write code in a more comfortable way? Right now, a really cool extension in VsCode can make you want to do more coding - Power Mode.

Using this extension, you can type the words with a cool animation behind, like the picture below.

It provides many options to choose the amination you like, such as particles, fireworks, flames, etc.

## Installation

Open the extension market and search for it in terms of "power mode". Install and enable it!

Open the __Manager - Setup__ and type "powermode" to restrict the search.

Click the combox the enable it. You can have particles behind the words now!

The __haking__ functionality is also fancy but not practical. It makes me feel annoyed due to the jumping code. I suggest to disable it.

You're able to adjust the __Explosion Frequency__, __Explosion Duration__, and __Explosion Size__ to do programming to get the good animation you love.

The most important thing is to select your favorite explosion animation. I love the particles because it brings me motivation and doesnâ€™t distract my thoughts. :)

Happy hacking!
